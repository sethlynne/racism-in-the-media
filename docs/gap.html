                        become a cheerleader for a plant. A plant that transformed me from a broken
                        multi-millionaire suicidal alcoholic with a lifetime of suffering, to a
                        happy, healed and heart-centered individual with freedom and purpose. My

                 <h6 class="display-6">Gerard Powell was the personification of the American businessman: rich, powerful and unhappy.</h6>

                <p>He opted to try anything available to hide from himself and his “perfect”
                    life. Most of his existence he suffered from addiction and depression,
                    incessantly trying to fill the hole deep within, with little or no success.
                    Ultimately, after much trial and error he found the key to true success
                    and happiness. Today, he serves as a conscious entrepreneur, thought leader,
                    philanthropist and public speaker on a mission to share the modalities
                    and philosophies that transformed his life.</p>
                <p>His business history is nothing short of miraculous. He grew up in a very
                    modest home, was not able to focus on school and ultimately dropped out.
                    After several unsuccessful business ventures, in 1991 he partnered in a
                    building and development company. His inner guidance directed him to discontinue
                    this line of work , however Gerard remained involved long enough to consummate
                    a deal that netted him more than a million dollars – while still in his
                    twenties.</p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                     <h1 class="display-1 text-coral db-quote db-quote--small">&ldquo;</h1>

                    <p>I sold my company for $94 million dollars. I had 5 houses, 20 plus cars,
                        and 2 planes. I achieved the American dream but I was hooked on Demerol,
                        was an alcoholic and was suicidal."</p>
                    <p>I realized something was very wrong because the more I acquired the more
                        I suffered. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and travelled the
                        world on my journey to heal myself through every self-help and healing
                        modality I could find. A friend introduced me to Plant Medicine and in
                        one night I had an experience that transformed my existence and liberated
                        me from a lifetime of suffering. That was 2 years ago and my life continues
                        to unfold in an extraordinary way. As a result of my experience I decided
                        to open a center in Costa Rica that would offer all of the modalities that
                        had the greatest impact on my life, enabling me to share them with as many
                        people as possible at a price they could afford. I modeled it after the
                        Club Med philosophy of an all-inclusive resort experience offering modalities,
                        accommodations, organic meals, and first class amenities.&rdquo;</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>That is how Rythmia Life Advancement Center was conceived. Rythmia Group,
                    Inc., a management company that manages certain aspects of the center,
                    is headquartered in the beachside community of, Malibu, California, where
                    Gerard also lives with his family. He visited Costa Rica and found the
                    current location of the Center in Guanacoste, one of the five blue zones
                    in the world where people live happiest and longest. He purchased an 81
                    bed hotel and renovated it making it the go-to facility for a spiritually
                    awakening vacation experience poised to enable guests to experience healing
                    and life transformation during their stay.</p>
                <p>Powell continues, “We have gathered, under one roof, a team of world-renowned
                    specialists offering the most breakthrough modalities including “The Answer
                    Is You”, life transformation program by Michael Beckwith; the Dead Sea
                    Cleanse, a hydrotherapy colonic cleanse that far surpassed any others I
                    tried; Prana Vinyasa Yoga by Shiva Rea; Plant Medicine by Sarab Deva and
                    Dr. Vanessa Grillo; and locally grown organic farm to table food PRESENTED
                    by Shivanter.” Another way in which he has opted to share his experiences
                    and findings is through Truthenomics, a program and website that teaches
                    the skills and insights essential to a life of manifestation. He has become
                    a leading Conscious Entrepreneur, creating progressive businesses that
                    transform people’s lives. He speaks to audiences and organizations relying
                    on his signature, unfiltered style that is filled with humor, authenticity
                    and an inherent ability to inspire.</p>
