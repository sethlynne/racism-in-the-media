# How It Works

The site uses the following node packages: bootstrap, browser-sync, cross-env, photoswipe, and glidejs and gulp. The assets (js, img, css, partials) in "src" are pre-compiled with gulp into the "docs" folder. The browser reads from this "docs" folder.

Bootstrap: front-end framework

Browser-sync: refresh the browser whenever a file is saved (for rapid development)

Cross-Env: Makes it so you can have a single command without worrying about setting or using the environment variable properly for the platform

Photoswipe: Vanilla JS image gallery package

GlideJS: Carousel package
